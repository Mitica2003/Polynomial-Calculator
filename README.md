# Polynomial Calculator

## Overview

Polynomial Calculator is a Java-based application designed to perform various mathematical operations on polynomials. It provides an intuitive interface for users to input polynomials and execute computations efficiently.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration of polynomials.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive GUI for easy input and operation selection.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Detects invalid inputs and prevents division by zero.
- **Efficient Performance**: Utilizes **TreeMap** for optimized polynomial representation.
- **Reliable Testing**: Ensured accuracy through unit tests implemented with **JUnit**.

## System Design

The project follows a modular architecture and is organized into key packages:

- **data_models** – Defines the polynomial representation and internal data structures.
- **business** – Implements the core logic for polynomial operations.
- **GUI** – Handles user interactions and displays results.
- **test** – Contains unit tests for validating functionality.

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended Variable Support**: Enable calculations with variables beyond 'x'.
- **Advanced Parsing**: Improve polynomial input recognition with enhanced regular expressions.
